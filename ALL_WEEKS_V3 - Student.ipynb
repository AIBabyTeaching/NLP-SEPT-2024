    "## Section 1: Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Introduction to NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a multidisciplinary field that combines computer science, linguistics, and artificial intelligence to enable machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP is ubiquitous in the modern digital world, powering applications such as voice assistants, translation services, and sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.1 What is NLP in the Real World?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP is applied in various real-world scenarios, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Analysis and Summarization**: Automated generation of concise summaries from large documents.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Assessing the emotional tone of texts in social media or customer reviews.\n",
    "- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another, as seen in Google Translate.\n",
    "- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: Enabling conversational interfaces in applications like Siri, Alexa, and customer support bots.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.1.2 NLP Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Key tasks in NLP include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or phrases.\n",
    "- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying entities like names, places, and organizations.\n",
    "- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Determining the grammatical category (noun, verb, etc.) of each word.\n",
    "- **Dependency Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.\n",
    "- **Text Classification**: Assigning predefined categories to text data, such as spam detection in emails.\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detecting the sentiment or emotion expressed in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 What is Language?\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is a complex system of communication used by humans, comprising various components that convey meaning and facilitate interaction. It consists of several fundamental building blocks:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.2.1 Building Blocks of Language\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Phonemes**: The smallest units of sound in a language. For example, the word \"cat\" has three phonemes: /k/, /æ/, and /t/.\n",
    "2. **Morphemes**: The smallest units of meaning. \"Unbelievable\" has three morphemes: \"un-\", \"believe\", and \"-able\".\n",
    "3. **Lexemes**: The set of all inflected forms of a single word. For example, \"run\" includes \"runs\", \"ran\", and \"running\".\n",
    "4. **Syntax**: The arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences. It governs the grammatical structure of language.\n",
    "5. **Context**: The situational background that influences the meaning of words and sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Introduction to Approaches to NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP can be approached using various methods, each with its strengths and limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.1 Heuristics-Based NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utilizes rule-based methods to process language.\n",
    "- Effective for well-defined, small-scale problems.\n",
    "- Example: Regular expressions for pattern matching in text.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.2 Machine Learning for NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uses statistical methods and algorithms to learn from data.\n",
    "- Techniques include supervised and unsupervised learning.\n",
    "- Common algorithms: Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and decision trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.3.3 Deep Learning for NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "- Leverages neural networks, especially deep neural networks, to model complex language patterns.\n",
    "- Significant advancements have been made with architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers.\n",
    "- Applications include language translation, text generation, and question answering.\n"

    "#### Terminology about last example!!\n",
    "\n",
    "How CountVectorizer Works:\n",
    "CountVectorizer is a simple and effective tool used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to convert a collection of text documents into a matrix of token counts. It essentially creates a Bag-of-Words (BoW) representation of the text data, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tokenization: It splits the text into words or tokens.\n",
    "- Vocabulary creation: It builds a vocabulary (unique words from the dataset).\n",
    "- Count representation: Each text document is then represented as a vector of word counts, i.e., how many times each word from the vocabulary appears in each document.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Is CountVectorizer the Best Option?\n",
    "While CountVectorizer is effective in many cases, it has limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ignores word importance: It treats all words equally, meaning frequent words like \"the\" or \"is\" get as much weight as important words, which may not be desirable.\n",
    "- Doesn't consider word context: It doesn't capture the relationship between words (e.g., \"New York\" is treated as two separate words rather than a single entity).\n",
    "- Sparse representations: For large vocabularies, the resulting matrix can be very sparse, with many zero entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Options and Their Differences:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**TfidfVectorizer** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency):\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: It transforms text into a matrix of TF-IDF features. It takes into account the frequency of a word in a document and its frequency across all documents. This way, less frequent but important words are given higher weight compared to common words.\n",
    "- Why it's better: It reduces the importance of frequently occurring words that may not be informative (like \"the\" or \"is\"), leading to better performance for some tasks.\n",
    "- Example: Words that appear in fewer documents will have higher weight, while common words will have a lower weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**HashingVectorizer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Similar to CountVectorizer, but instead of building a vocabulary, it uses a hashing trick to map terms to indices in a fixed-size vector space.\n",
    "- Why it's different: No need to store a vocabulary, which saves memory. This can be useful when dealing with very large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Downside: It's not possible to reverse the transformation and map back to the original words since hashing is a one-way process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word2Vec or GloVe (Word Embeddings)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What it does: Instead of representing words based on their counts, it captures the semantic meaning of words by embedding them into dense vectors. Similar words are mapped close to each other in the vector space.\n",
    "- Why it's better: It captures semantic relationships between words, so words like \"king\" and \"queen\" would have similar vectors, while traditional vectorizers treat them as completely different.\n",
    "- Downside: More complex to train and use, but it can provide more informative features, especially for tasks that benefit from semantic understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT, GPT, and other transformer-based models**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What they do: These models use deep learning to generate context-aware word embeddings. Each word is represented based on the context in which it appears.\n",
    "- Why it's better: Unlike CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer, they capture the meaning of a word depending on its surrounding words, making them much more powerful for complex NLP tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and question answering.\n",
    "Downside: Computationally expensive and require large datasets for training. They also need more processing power compared to simpler vectorizers.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use Which?\n",
    "- For simple tasks with limited data: CountVectorizer or - TfidfVectorizer are usually sufficient. TfidfVectorizer tends to perform better in cases where the frequency of common words needs to be downplayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For large-scale or production tasks: HashingVectorizer is useful when dealing with very large datasets, especially when memory is a concern.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For advanced NLP tasks requiring semantic understanding: Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) or transformer-based models like BERT are more powerful, capturing context and meaning."

    "### Elevator Pitch (Seamless Intro):\n",
    "NER: Identifies and classifies entities in text (e.g., names, locations, dates) using machine learning or rule-based algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec: Creates dense word embeddings that capture semantic similarity between words by positioning similar words close in a vector space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference: NER is for entity classification, while Word2Vec is for semantic word relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combination: Using Word2Vec embeddings can improve NER by providing better context understanding for entity recognition and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes: Mathematical representation of word is the vector! The features in this example are [authority, have tail, rich, male]. Surrounding words are the context.\n",
    "> Example the word King: King has authority, king does not have tail, king is rich, king gender is male\n",
    ">> Authority: 1, Has tail = 0, Rich = 1, Gender = -1\n",
    "> Example the word man: \n",
    ">> Authority: 0.2, Has tail = 0, Rich = 0.3, Gender = -1\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Introduction to Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "In natural language processing (NLP), understanding the relationships between words is crucial. Traditionally, words were represented as sparse vectors using techniques like one-hot encoding, which lacked semantic meaning. **Word2Vec**, developed by Google, addresses this by creating dense vector representations (embeddings) where similar words have similar vectors, effectively capturing the semantic meaning of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use Cases for Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec’s dense embeddings are powerful for many applications in NLP:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentiment Analysis**: Words with similar sentiments (e.g., \"good\" and \"great\") have similar vector representations.\n",
    "- **Recommendation Systems**: Identifying item similarities based on descriptions or reviews.\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Using vector similarity to match contextually similar phrases or words.\n",
    "\n",
    "These embeddings allow algorithms to measure similarity between words, which helps in clustering, classification, and many downstream NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. How Word2Vec Works: Models and Training\n",
    "\n",
    "Word2Vec learns word representations through a shallow neural network. It has two main models:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)**: Predicts a word based on its surrounding words (context).\n",
    "2. **Skip-Gram**: Predicts surrounding context words given a single word.\n",
    "\n",
    "These models learn to map words to a high-dimensional space where semantically related words are closer to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Skip-Gram Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Skip-Gram model** is useful when we want to understand the broader context of a word. For example, given a target word \\( w_t \\), it tries to predict words within a context window of size \\( c \\) around \\( w_t \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function for Skip-Gram\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given target word \\( w_t \\) and its context words \\( w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t+c} \\), the objective is to maximize the log probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\sum_{-c \\leq j \\leq c, j \\neq 0} \\log P(w_{t+j} | w_t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \\( T \\) is the total number of words in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "This probability \\( P(w_{t+j} | w_t) \\) is computed with a softmax function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(w_O | w_I) = \\frac{\\exp(v'_{w_O} \\cdot v_{w_I})}{\\sum_{w=1}^{W} \\exp(v'_w \\cdot v_{w_I})}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- \\( v_{w_I} \\) is the input vector for the word \\( w_I \\),\n",
    "- \\( v'_{w_O} \\) is the output vector for the word \\( w_O \\), and\n",
    "- \\( W \\) is the vocabulary size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to Skip-Gram, **CBOW** predicts a target word \\( w_t \\) based on surrounding context words. CBOW is often faster and more accurate for frequent words.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function for CBOW\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function for CBOW is to maximize the log probability of predicting the target word given its context:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{1}{T} \\sum_{t=1}^T \\log P(w_t | w_{t-c}, \\dots, w_{t+c})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "CBOW captures context effectively and is computationally more efficient for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Optimization Techniques: Negative Sampling and Hierarchical Softmax\n",
    "\n",
    "Training with a large vocabulary can be computationally expensive. Word2Vec employs two key techniques to optimize this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Sampling**: Rather than updating weights for every word, it updates only for a few sampled \"negative\" words.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  The negative sampling objective is:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \\log \\sigma(v'_{w_O} \\cdot v_{w_I}) + \\sum_{i=1}^k \\mathbb{E}_{w_i \\sim P_n(w)} \\left[ \\log \\sigma(-v'_{w_i} \\cdot v_{w_I}) \\right]\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  where \\( \\sigma(x) \\) is the sigmoid function and \\( P_n(w) \\) is the distribution for sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Softmax**: Uses a binary tree structure to reduce complexity when calculating softmax probabilities, beneficial for large vocabularies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Limitations of Word2Vec\n",
    "\n",
    "While Word2Vec is powerful, it has some limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lacks Contextuality**: Each word has a single representation, regardless of the context in which it appears. This limits its ability to handle words with multiple meanings (polysemy).\n",
    "- **Static Embeddings**: The embeddings are static, meaning they do not dynamically adapt based on sentence context.\n",
    "- **Memory Intensive**: For large vocabularies, Word2Vec requires significant memory to store embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Example of Word2Vec in Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a sentence: \"The cat sits on the mat.\" Using a window size of 2, the Skip-Gram model might generate training pairs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (\"cat\", \"the\"), (\"cat\", \"sits\"), (\"sits\", \"cat\"), (\"sits\", \"on\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will learn vectors for \"cat,\" \"sits,\" \"on,\" etc., so that contextually similar words (e.g., \"cat\" and \"dog\") end up with similar embeddings, capturing semantic relationships in the data.\n",
